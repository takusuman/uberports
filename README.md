# uberports - *"Ports Ã¼ber alles!"*

## What is it?
**uberports** is a **free** (as in freedom of speech) and hackable Slackbuild manager that works just like BSD Ports.  

## Why?
- First of all, competition is good, principally if it's offering more freedom;  
- Another implementations (like sport/slackports or retroports) are GPL'ed unnecessarily (see my thoughts at **COPYRIGHT**, in the manual page);  
- The cited above implementations are hard to read/hack and bloated.  
So, at the height of my ego, i've thought that i could do it better, __and i did it__ along with a video (in portuguese, without subtitles for now) showing the process, which is linked below.

## Acknowledgements
`uberports` is strongly inspired by Jefferson "slackjeff" Carneiro's [`retroports`](http://github.com/slackjeff/retroports), so it possibly wouldn't exist as we know if it weren't for Carneiro's work.  
And of course: both wouldn't exist if it weren't for the years of work by the [Slackbuilds](http://slackbuilds.org/) and [Slackware](http://www.slackware.com/) team.  
Thanks to all!
